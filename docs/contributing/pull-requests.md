# Submiting Pull Requests

* Target your pull requests to the **version-2** branch
* Add/Update any relevant docs articles in the relevant package's docs folder related to your changes
* Include a test for any new functionality and ensure all existing tests are passing by running `npm test`
* Ensure linting checks pass by typing `npm run lint`
* Keep your PRs as simple as possible and describe the changes to help the reviewer understand your work
* If you have an idea for a larger change to the library please [open an issue](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/issues) and let's discuss before you invest many hours - these are very welcome but want to ensure it is something we can merge before you spend the time :)

> If you need to target a PR for version 1, please target the "version-1" branch
